How to Almost Build a Beer Pong Playing Robot

In April of 2021 I was looking for a project to spend my ample amount of free time on. For some reason a beer pong playing robot popped into my head. At a high level I envisioned a robot that would use a camera to find cups and fire a ping pong ball at said cups. I decided a Raspberry Pi would be used as the “brain” and would handle the image processing. The Raspberry Pi would tell an Arduino how to orientate the firing mechanism. Having a 3D printer I planned to print a majority of the firing mechanism. Over the next year I would spend my time designing, testing, and redesigning various aspects of the robot in hopes of improving its accuracy. I am writing this to document all of the effort I put into to the project and in hopes of it helping someone else.
